Recipe Assignment from The Odin Project

This project has been assigned by the Odin Project to put into practice what I have learned about HTML and Git. It will include a basic HTML recipe website demonstrating my ability to create HTML documents and properly use a variety of HTML elements. The repository will contain several commits demonstrating a basic understanding of Git and writing good commit messages.
